Subject: [PATCH] drm/msm/dpu1: don't choke on disabling the writeback
 connector
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

During suspend/resume process all connectors are explicitly disabled and
then reenabled. However resume fails because of the connector_status check:

[ 1185.831970] [dpu error]connector not connected 3

It doesn't make sense to check for the Writeback connected status (and
other drivers don't perform such check), so drop the check.

Fixes: 71174f362d67 ("drm/msm/dpu: move writeback's atomic_check to dpu_writeback.c")
